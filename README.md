# Identify-singer-from-songs

Sometimes we just want to know the singer of the current song that you are listening to.

I train a classification network to identify the singer by its feature.

Trying fout kinds of different features, the best accuracy I could get is 39.2%.

I think the scale of the training data is the main reason cause the low accuracy.
